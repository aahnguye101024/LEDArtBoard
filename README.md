# LEDArtBoard
This project is an ESP32 that can control a huge array of leds in order to generate pixel art. With a single 12V input, you can power on an ESP32 and huge array of leds (at very low current draw for each led). It was intended as a gift for a friend, where I could upload an array of values with specific RGB codes to display that color in that specific led location on the array. It was also to test JLCPCB's new at the time feature to assemble PCBs for a super low cost.
